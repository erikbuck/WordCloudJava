# Challenge
Generate a Word Cloud: 

- Read words from an InputStream. 
- Filter out "noise" words obtained by reading from another InputStream.
- Build a HashMap that identifies how many times each word occurs.
- Create a list of the *n* most commonly occurring words. 
- Generate a Word Cloud using those *n* most commonly occurring words.

## Java Solution
This VS Code project contains a Java solution to the challenge.

## VS Code Java

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
